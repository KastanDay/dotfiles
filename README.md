## Current .zshrc file requres this setup:
Emulator: Hyper Terminal www.hyper.is
	Config is in default location (rn at â€¦../kasta/)
	/.hyper.js
    Hyper keyboard shortcuts here: https://hyper.is/#keymaps and https://github.com/zeit/hyper/blob/master/app/keymaps/linux.json
Use ZSH and Oh-My-Zsh
Use PowerLevel9k  - https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#step-2-install-a-powerline-font
Use NerdFonts - http://nerdfonts.com/ 
	Must add font to .hyper.js config file. Make sure use name listed on install file.
	Use Windows compatible fonts
All fonts downloaded from here have the full nerdfont icon packs.
Source Code Pro font:
On Windows & WSL it's called: "SauceCodePro NF"
On Ubuntu it's called: "SauceCodePro Nerd Font"


Notes:
Be careful with the .bashrc and .zshrc files - THEY MAY CONTAIN WEIRD THINGS AT THE BOTTOM. The branches are an effort to isolate weirdness.

Great tutorial on setting up WSL (to be good - with X server and good fonts)
