## Current `.zshrc` file requres this setup:
- Emulator: Hyper Terminal www.hyper.is
	
	- Config is in default location (rn at â€¦../kasta/)
	- `~/.hyper.js`
    	- Hyper keyboard shortcuts here: https://hyper.is/#keymaps and https://github.com/zeit/hyper/blob/master/app/keymaps/linux.json
- Use ZSH and Oh-My-Zsh
	- Only install step: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- Use PowerLevel9k  - https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#step-2-install-a-powerline-font
	- Only install step: `$ git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k`
- Use NerdFonts - http://nerdfonts.com/ 
	- All fonts downloaded from here have the full nerdfont icon packs.
	- Must add font to `~/.hyper.js` config file. Make sure use name listed on install file.
	- Use "Windows compatible" fonts
	- Source Code Pro font:
		- On Windows & WSL it's called: "SauceCodePro NF"
		- On Ubuntu it's called: "SauceCodePro Nerd Font"
- Use [ZHS-Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
	- Make sure to do the `Oh My Zsh` setup (not defautl)!
	- Only install step: `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
	- `ctrl + space` to accept and execute suggestion
	- `ctrl + j` to accept suggestion, and edit.
- Terminal syntax highlighting
    - Syntax highlighting from https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md
    - Only install step: `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting`
- [color-ls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls) makes your ls call beautiful
	- in `.zshrc` add: `alias ls=colorls`


## Awesome _____

## Useful terminal applications
- Beyond `grep`: `ag`
	- `sudo apt-get install silversearcher-ag`
	- Usage: `ag foo` searches inside files for 'foo'. `ag -g file` serches for filename 'file'.
- [In-terminal markdown viewer](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer) `mdv`
    - This is the best of several I considered: 
- [bro man pages](http://bropages.org/)
	- tldr is another option
## Visual Studeio Code config

- `settings.json` - This is the only settings file for VS Code
	 - It is stored in `~/.config/Code/User/`

**Extensions** 
- Vim, Relative Line Numbers (by extr0py), C/C++

- Remember to keep using Vim's EasyMotion commands (remapped to s<char>) to do movements! 


CAUTION:

Be careful with the `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` files - **THEY MAY CONTAIN WEIRD THINGS AT THE BOTTOM.** The branches are an effort to isolate weirdness.

Great tutorial on setting up WSL (to be good - with X server and good fonts)
